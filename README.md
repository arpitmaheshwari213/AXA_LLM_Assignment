# Installed and used Ocra Mini Model Locally
The model Orca Mini 3B is part of the Orca family, specifically designed for general-purpose use. Here are some key details:

* `Architecture`: Based on the LLaMA architecture, it contains approximately 3 billion parameters.
* `File Size`: The model file, q4_0-orca-mini-3b.gguf, is about 1.98 GB​
* `Quantization`: It uses the Q4_0 quantization, making it suitable for running on entry-level hardware​
* `Training Data`: The Orca models were trained using data from "Orca Style" datasets, which incorporate learning from complex explanation traces similar to GPT-4​
* `Usage`: It can be used for tasks like text generation, and examples of API calls to interact with the model are provided in its documentation​
